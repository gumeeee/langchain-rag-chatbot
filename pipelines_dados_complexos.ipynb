        "- Processar PDFs complexos que contêm texto e tabelas com a biblioteca `unstructured`.\n",
        "- Aplicar estratégias de chunking inteligentes com `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.\n",
        "- Ingerir dados de um banco de dados SQL com `DuckDB` e transformá-los em `Documentos`.\n",
        "- Enriquecer nossos `Documentos` com metadados estratégicos para potencializar as buscas.\n",

        "### Por que pipelines de dados são essenciais para RAG?\n",
        "- **Qualidade do Contexto**: A forma como você processa e divide seus dados (chunking) afeta diretamente o contexto que o LLM recebe, e, portanto, a qualidade da resposta.\n",
        "- **Diversidade de Fontes**: Sistemas de RAG em produção se alimentam de múltiplas fontes: PDFs, bancos de dados, APIs, etc.\n",
        "- **Metadados**: São a chave para buscas filtradas, rastreabilidade e controle de acesso, tornando seu RAG muito mais poderoso."
