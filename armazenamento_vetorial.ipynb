        "\n",
        "#### 1. Índice Flat (Busca Exata)\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Como funciona:** Compara o seu item de busca com **todos** os outros itens no banco de dados, um por um.\n",
        "* **Vantagem:** Precisão de 100%. Você tem a garantia de encontrar os resultados exatos.\n",
        "* **Desvantagem:** Lento para muitos dados, pois o número de comparações é enorme.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. Índice HNSW (Busca Aproximada)\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Como funciona:** Cria uma estrutura de dados otimizada (um grafo) que permite pular comparações desnecessárias. A busca é guiada de forma inteligente para a área mais provável dos resultados.\n",
        "* **Vantagem:** Extremamente mais rápido, ideal para aplicações em tempo real com grandes volumes de dados.\n",
        "* **Desvantagem:** A precisão não é 100%. A busca é muito boa, mas pode, raramente, deixar de fora o resultado mais exato. Essa perda é geralmente aceitável em troca da velocidade.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusão sobre o LangChain:**\n",
        "Por padrão, o LangChain usa o método **Flat**. Ele escolhe a segurança (100% de precisão) em vez da velocidade, pois é mais simples e confiável para projetos iniciais ou pequenos.\n",

        "* **Pró:** **Extremamente rápido**, mesmo com milhões de itens.\n",
        "* **Contra:** A precisão não é 100% (mas geralmente acima de 99%) e consome mais memória.\n",
